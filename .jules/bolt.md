**Learning:** Extracting inner functions defined inside hot loops (like training steps or FLOPs calculation) to the module level significantly reduces function creation overhead, especially in high-frequency calls.
**Action:** Always check frequently called functions for inner function definitions that don't rely on closure over changing variables.
