# How to Submit a PR

## Step 1: Add PR label `Expert Review`

## Step 2: Collect the expert reviewers reviews

1. Attach the `Expert Review` label when your PR is ready for review.
2. GitHub auto-assigns expert reviewers based on your changes. They will get notified and pick up your PR soon.

:warning: Only proceed to the next step once all reviewers have approved, merge-conflict are resolved and the CI is passing.  
Final Review might get declined if these requirements are not fulfilled.

## Step 3: Final Review

1. Add `Final Review` label
2. GitHub auto-assigns final reviewers based on your changes. They will get notified and pick up your PR soon.
